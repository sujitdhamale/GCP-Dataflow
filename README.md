### Apache Beam

- Apache Beam is an open source unified programming model to define both batch and streaming processing pipelines.
- To create a pipeline, you can use the Beam SDK of the language of your choice to build a program that defines your data-processing pipeline.
- A pipeline can be run locally on your computer, remotely on a virtual machine in a data center, or by using the services of a cloud provider
- To decide which will be the engine powering your pipeline, you need to specify a runner. Each runner has its own configuration, and it is associated with a backend service.
- **Dataflow** is one of the runners available in Apache Beam.
