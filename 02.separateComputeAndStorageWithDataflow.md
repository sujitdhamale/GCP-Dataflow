- Dataflow allows you to execute your VM pipelines on Google Cloud.
- it is fully managed and autoconfigured.
- Graph Optimization : Dataflow optimizes the graph execution by fusing operations efficiently and by not waiting for previous steps to finish before starting a new one unless there is a dependency involved.
- Resource Autoscaling : autoscaling happens step by step in the middle of a pipeline job.
- Dataflow will turn down the workers as the job demand decreases.
- Dataflow can also handle later-arriving records with intelligent watermarking
