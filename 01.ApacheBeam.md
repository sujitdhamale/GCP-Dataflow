# Apache Beam 

## Beam Portabilty 
- The Beam vision is to provide a comprehensive portability framework for data processing pipelines, 
 one that allows you to write your pipeline once in the programming language of your choice and run it with minimal effort on the execution engine of your choice.
- you can define your pipeline in popular languages like Java, Python, Go, SQL.
- With Beam, you also have the flexibility to move your data processing pipeline from your own premise environment to Dataflow on Google Cloud or any other clouds
- There is no vendor lock-in
- The portability framework is a language-agnostic way of representing and executing Beam pipelines
- **language-agnostic**  :  The portability framework is a language-agnostic way of representing and executing Beam pipelines
- **interoperability layer=Portability API** : It introduces well-defined, language neutral data structures and protocols between the SDKs and the runners. This interoperability layer is called Portability API and enables you to use the language of your choice with the runner of your choice, thus ensuring that SDKs and runners can work with each other uniformly
- **docker containerization** is used, you can customize the execution environment running on the worker nodes of the back end service

#### Bebefit of Portibility 
-  With portability, **every runner** can work with every supported language
-  Containerization allows us a configurable, hermetic **worker environment**
-  Multi-language pilepline
-  cross language transforms
-  Fater delivery of **new Features**

## Dataflow Runner V2
- most efficient and portable worker architecture 
- Based on Apache Beam Portability 
- Supports custom containers, multi-language pipelines and cross-language transforms.
- Runner is packaged together with the Dataflow Shuffle service and Streaming Engine 


## Container Environment 
- containerized with Docker to isolate it from other runtime systems
- Pre-Operation  execution environment 
- Default Environment per SDK
- Ahead-of-time installation
- Arbitrary dependencies
- Arbitrary customization

## Cross Language Transform
- you are no longer limited to a single language in a given pipeline.
- Portability makes it possible for you to run multi-language pipelines that leverage the respective benefits of the individualized case
