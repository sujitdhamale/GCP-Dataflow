# Apache Beam 

### Beam Portabilty 
- The Beam vision is to provide a comprehensive portability framework for data processing pipelines, 
 one that allows you to write your pipeline once in the programming language of your choice and run it with minimal effort on the execution engine of your choice.
- you can define your pipeline in popular languages like Java, Python, Go, SQL.
- With Beam, you also have the flexibility to move your data processing pipeline from your own premise environment to Dataflow on Google Cloud or any other clouds
- There is no vendor lock-in
- The portability framework is a language-agnostic way of representing and executing Beam pipelines
